# Crane Design Project

A **miniature crane** concept for a wind turbine installation scenario, developed as a **Group** project. This design simulates real-world engineering considerations: material constraints, statics and dynamics, and precise load handling.

---

## Overview

The project aimed to build a scale crane capable of lifting a 223g rotor and placing it into a wind turbine hub at **18.9 inches** height without external interference. This exercise integrated **mechanical design**, **CAD modeling**, and **rapid prototyping** under strict constraints.

## Key Details
 
- **Goal**: Build a crane to lift a rotor from 2.36" off the ground and place it into a hub 18.9" high  
- **Constraints**:
  - 4x4 foot operational area  
  - Max 15 cubic inches of 3D-printed custom parts  
  - No external interactions after initial placement

---

## Design Highlights

- **Base Movement**: Skid-steer mechanism with independent front wheel motors  
- **Rotor Pick-Up**: A rotating “finger joint” ensures secure alignment and minimal swinging  
- **Vertical Lift**: 3D-printed rack and pinion system for precise height adjustments  
- **Stability**: Calculated moment balance with a box-section arm and counterweight

---

## Technologies Used

- **CAD** (SolidWorks or similar) for design and assembly drawings  
- **3D Printing** for rack, pinion, and bracket components  
- **Wood & Plywood** for base structure  
- **Git/GitHub** for version control

---

## Assembly & Instructions

1. **Base Assembly**: Construct the 4-wheel chassis, attach motors and support beams.  
2. **Tower & Rack**: Mount the vertical tower, attach the 3D-printed rack, and align the pinion system.  
3. **Boom Arm**: Use a box-section arm for lightweight strength, connect via the tower collar.  
4. **Rotor Holder**: 3D-printed joint that grabs the rotor horizontally, then rotates it into the hub.

## Challenges & Lessons

- **Torque & Load**: Ensuring motors could handle rotor weight with a safe factor of stability.  
- **3D Print Dependency**: Delays in receiving critical parts meant partial testing until final pieces arrived.  
- **Time Constraints**: Adjusting designs (e.g., from pulley to finger joint) to simplify and reduce complexity.

## Future Improvements

- **Complete Motor Integration** for final lift testing  
- **Refine 3D Parts** for faster printing or less fragility  
- **Automated Controls** for precise robotic movement (potentially with sensors or microcontrollers)
