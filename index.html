    <p>A scale-model crane concept for wind turbine rotor assembly, built in ENGI 2203.</p>

  <!-- OVERVIEW SECTION -->
  <section id="overview">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This crane design project, completed for ENGI 2203, focuses on creating a 
      miniature-scale crane capable of lifting, transporting, and placing a rotor 
      within a wind turbine hub. Built with limited materials and under strict size 
      and weight constraints, the crane simulates real-world engineering considerations 
      in wind turbine installation and demonstrates proficiency in materials, dynamics, 
      and statics.

    <h2>My Role & Key Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conceptual Design & Analysis:</strong> Contributed to brainstorming crane 
        mechanisms (mobile vs. tower crane) and performed initial torque, moment, and 
        stability calculations.</li>
      <li><strong>Report Compilation & Editing:</strong> Coordinated the writing of the 
        design documentation, ensuring requirements, constraints, and design logic 
        were clearly explained.</li>
      <li><strong>CAD & Rapid Prototyping Liaison:</strong> Communicated with TAs for 
        3D-printed components (rack & pinion, rotor holder) and integrated them into 
        the design plan.</li>
      <li><strong>Build & Assembly:</strong> Assisted with base assembly (wheel mechanism) 
        and tower assembly to ensure the crane fit within the 4x4 foot area.</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- PROBLEM & REQUIREMENTS SECTION -->
  <section id="problem">
    <h2>Problem & Requirements</h2>
    <h3>Summary of the Problem</h3>
    <p>
      Cranes are crucial for constructing wind turbines, lifting rotor assemblies 
      without damage. Our task was to build a scale model using a predefined kit 
      plus limited 3D-printed parts. The crane needed to pick a 223g rotor from 
      a 4x4 foot area (2.36" off ground) and place it precisely in a hub 
      at 18.9" height—without external interaction or dragging.
    </p>

    <h3>Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Only kit materials + 15 cubic inches of rapid prototyping material.</li>
      <li>Must fit in a 4x4 foot zone, accommodate rotor (17.52" blade) and hub (6.29" x 4.72").</li>
      <li>No external interaction after initial placement of rotor in crane grip.</li>
      <li>Crane must not tip over with or without the 2.18N rotor load.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lift and place the rotor safely inside the hub.</li>
      <li>Operate without damaging the rotor or dragging it on the ground.</li>
      <li>Standalone operation (no external forces beyond initial setup).</li>
      <li>Must be competition-ready on specified dates.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DESIGN CONCEPT SECTION -->
  <section id="design-concept">
    <h2>Design Concept</h2>
    <p>
      Our final crane is a hybrid between a mobile crane (for movement on wheels) 
      and a tower crane (for vertical height). Key subsystems include:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Base Movement Mechanism:</strong> A skid-steer approach using two front 
          wheels driven by independent motors for rotation and precise positioning.</li>
      <li><strong>Rotor Pick-Up Mechanism:</strong> A rotating “finger joint” on the boom 
          arm that clamps onto the rotor, then pivots to correctly align it for hub insertion.</li>
      <li><strong>Vertical Movement (Rack & Pinion):</strong> The crane arm ascends or descends 
          along a 3D-printed rack mounted on the tower, driven by a motor-powered pinion for 
          precise vertical placement.</li>
    </ol>

  <!-- CHALLENGES & OUTCOMES SECTION -->
  <section id="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges & Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Stability vs. Mobility:</strong> Balancing a lightweight design with enough 
        counterweight to stay upright when lifting the rotor.  
        <br><em>Outcome:</em> Used a skid-steer base with well-placed support towers and 
        verified through moment calculations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>3D-Printed Parts Dependency:</strong> Delays in receiving critical printed 
        parts (rack, pinion, rotor bracket) stalled final testing.  
        <br><em>Outcome:</em> Created contingency plans for part breakage and tested partial 
        prototypes to ensure correct tolerances.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rotor Orientation:</strong> Needed a reliable mechanism to rotate the rotor 
        from horizontal to vertical.  
        <br><em>Outcome:</em> Switched from a complex pulley-based system to a simpler 
        rotating finger joint, reducing build complexity and potential failure points.
      </li>
    </ul>
