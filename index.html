        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            In the real-life installation of wind turbines, cranes play a crucial role in the building process. For this installation, a variety of crane types can be used, but all must be able to fulfill the same tasks: pick up the load of a rotor without damaging it and place it with precision into the hub. For our design problem, we were tasked with creating a miniature-scale crane with given materials and placing a rotor inside a hub at a set location. The purpose of this project was to further our understanding of materials, dynamics, and statics and implement our classroom knowledge into a real-life situation through a mock engineering design project. In this report, a more detailed problem statement will be defined along with specific dimensions and constraints which are crucial to a successful completion of the problem. The report will show a design solution; complete with specific part purposes and operations, building instructions, detailed CAD drawings, and an overview of the concepts used. In addition, up-to-date results will be displayed, with a Gantt chart schedule showing a plan for theoretical future tasks needing completion and the dates by which they should have been done. The design will then be evaluated with its limitations being examined.

        <h2>Summary of Problem</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            A crane is an extremely useful and powerful machine that is able to pick up and rotate heavy objects off the ground, transport said objects to the target site, and attach or fix them into the desired position. A crane is typically mounted with a hoist rope, wire ropes, or chains and sheaves. Cranes are typically used in the civil engineering and construction industries for the construction of bridges, tracks, and high-placement structures.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
            To design and build a crane device that can pick up and insert a rotor weighing 223 grams in a horizontal orientation from a location 1 foot by 1 foot from the corner of a 4x4 foot area lying 2.36 inches off the ground. The rotor then must be placed into a wind turbine base centered 3 feet away from the edge of the 4x4 foot area at a height of 18.9 inches off the ground. In addition, the crane must be able to take the rotor out of the hub and place it back on the ground.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>
            The crane device can only be made of materials given in the kit as specified in the design kit PDF. In addition to these items, each team is allotted 15 cubic inches of rapid prototyping material for custom parts. The crane device must fit within a 4 by 4-foot area with space for both the rotor blade and turbine hub to sit. After attaching the rotor to the device, no external interaction is allowed until the rotor is placed within the hub. The rotor must not be dragged along the ground and must be undamaged when placed within the hub.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            The following requirements have been selected as essential to completing the project:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The crane design must be able to stand without tipping with and without the 2.18N load of the rotor.</li>
            <li>The crane design must be ready for the qualifying stage on March 16th and final competition on March 30th.</li>
            <li>The crane may not drag the rotor on the ground.</li>
            <li>The crane must fit within the 4x4 foot area with space for the 17.52-inch blade rotor and the 6.29x4.72-inch hub base.</li>
            <li>The crane must be able to place the rotor in the hub without external forces.</li>
            <li>The crane must be able to complete all tasks safely.</li>
        </ul>
